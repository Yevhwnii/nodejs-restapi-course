# nodejs-restapi-course
NodeJS + ExpressJS applicaiton which was developed by me following instructor explanation and comments. Created in order to learn how REST APIs work internally and explore
how to create my own one. Frontend of applicaiton was provided by instructor, in my turn I adjusted it to work together. It is part of NodeJs course I took, main parts which 
actually classic NodeJs application is here: https://github.com/Yevhwnii/nodejs-shop-course

Skills acquired:
1. Understanding what REST APIs is, its underlying concepts and  features, how to decouple frontend and backend in application and created general vision on this type of NodeJs applications
2. Learned how I can create my own REST API using Nodejs and Express, how should I interact with request and which response my server should send back
3. Learned how do I authenticate and authorize users on server side (using jwt token)
4. Learned how do I validate user inputs in REST API world
5. Learned how do I perform error handling on the server so that frontend part can use it afterwards
6. Understanding async await concept in JavaScript, how it works and how to use it
7. Understanding websockets, what they are and how to implement them through Socket.io package 
8. Creating this type of Node application actually involves all skills acquired during development of classic Node app since the logic remains the same, only some parts are different
